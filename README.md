# Data Cleaning and Analysis using SQL
## Overview
This project demonstrates techniques such as data cleaning as well as exploratory data analysis using SQL.
- Data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis process, ensuring that your data is accurate, consistent, and usable for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis is the process of analysing the dataset thoroughly to find some possible answers to the questions related to dataset.

In this project, we will use SQL to clean a dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats, then we will perform some queries related to the EDA process to gain some insights based on the cleaned data.
The goal of this project is to transform raw data into a clean, analyzable format and to extract meaningful insights through various SQL queries and techniques.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply data cleaning techniques using SQL.
- Learn how to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in a dataset.
- Practice converting data types, normalizing data, and ensuring data integrity.
- Use some complex queries to calculate some of the key metrics that are interesting to look at.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to company layoffs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the `Layoffs Dataset`. It includes information about company layoffs, such as the company name, industry, number of layoffs, and the date of the layoffs. The dataset contains around 2600 rows and 9 columns.
The columns are :
- company
- location
- industry
- date
- total_laid_off
- percent_laid_off
- stage
- funds_raised_in_millions
- country

Its already present in the path `Data/layoffs.csv` so you can get access to the data. \
This data is sourced from "Kaggle" platform.
